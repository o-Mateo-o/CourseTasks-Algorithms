### Description
---
This repository contains my assignments for the university course Algorithms and Data Structures. Solutions are fully documented and described via introductions and mathematical formulas.

The main topics are:

* function complexity analysis,
* abstract data types implementation,
* comparison of the various implementations (for the same data structure),
* problem-solving based on the abstract data types usage.

The format is mainly Jupyter Notebook to make my considerations and implementations as clear as it was possible.

My solutions are available in the *Notebooks* folder. Descriptions of the solved problems are in the *ProblemsDescriprion* folder.
